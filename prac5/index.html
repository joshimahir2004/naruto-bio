        <h1 class="n-name">Naruto Usumaki</h1>
        <p class="info">Naruto (Japanese: NARUTOナルト) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi
            Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and
            dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts - the first set in
            Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. The series is based on two one-shot manga by
            Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award
            the following year, and Naruto (1997).
            <br>
            <br>
            Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's magazine, Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1999 to 2014, and released in
            tankōbon (book) form in 72 volumes. The manga was adapted into an anime television series produced by
            Pierrot and Aniplex, which broadcast 220 episodes in Japan from 2002 to 2007; the English dub of the
            series aired on Cartoon Network and YTV from 2005 to 2009.
            <br>
            <br>
            Naruto: Shippuden, a sequel to the original series, premiered in Japan in 2007, and ended in 2017, after
            500 episodes. The English dub was broadcast on Disney XD from 2009 to 2011, airing the first 98
            episodes, and then switched over to Adult Swim's Toonami programming block in January 2014, starting
            over from the first episode. The English dub is still airing weekly on Adult Swim to this day. Viz Media
            began streaming the anime series on their streaming service Neon Alley in December 2012 on 99 episodes,
            and ended in March 2016, after 338 episodes. Besides the anime series, Pierrot has developed eleven
            movies and twelve original video animations (OVAs). Other Naruto-related merchandise includes light
            novels, video games, and trading cards developed by several companies.
            <br>
            <br>
            Viz Media licensed the manga and anime for North American production and serialized Naruto in their
            digital Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. The anime series began airing in the United States and Canada in
            2005, and in the United Kingdom and Australia in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The films and most OVAs
            from the series were also released by Viz, with the first film premiering in movie theaters. The story
            of Naruto continues with Naruto's son, Boruto Uzumaki, in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations: Boruto wishes
            to create his own ninja way instead of following his father's

                A powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks Konoha, the hidden leaf village in the Land of Fire, one
                of the Five Great Shinobi Countries in the Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha and the Fourth
                Hokage, Minato Namikaze seals the fox inside the body of his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki, making Naruto
                a host of the beast;[i] this costs Naruto's father his life, and the Third Hokage returns from
                retirement to become the leader of Konoha again. Naruto is often scorned by Konoha's villagers for being
                the host of the Nine-Tails. Due to a decree by the Third Hokage forbidding any mention of these events,
                Naruto learns nothing about the Nine-Tails until 12 years later, when Mizuki, a renegade ninja, reveals
                the truth to Naruto. Naruto then defeats Mizuki in combat, earning the respect of his teacher, Iruka
                Umino.[ii]
                <br>
                <br>

                Shortly afterward, Naruto becomes a ninja and joins with Sasuke Uchiha, against whom he often competes,
                and Sakura Haruno, on whom he has a crush, to form Team 7, under an experienced sensei, the elite ninja
                Kakashi Hatake. Like all the ninja teams from every village, Team 7 completes missions requested by the
                villagers, ranging from doing chores and being bodyguards to performing assassinations.
                <br>
                <br>

                After several missions, including a major one in the Land of Waves, Kakashi allows Team 7 to take a
                ninja exam, enabling them to advance to a higher rank and take on more difficult missions, known as
                Chunin Exams. During the exams, Orochimaru, a wanted criminal, invades Konoha and kills the Third Hokage
                for revenge. Jiraiya, one of the three legendary ninjas, declines the title of Fifth Hokage and searches
                with Naruto for Tsunade whom he chooses to become Fifth Hokage instead.

                <br>
                <br>
                During the search, it is revealed that Orochimaru wishes to train Sasuke because of his powerful genetic
                heritage, the Sharingan. [iii] After Sasuke attempts and fails to kill his older brother Itachi,[iv] who
                had showed up in Konoha to kidnap Naruto, he joins Orochimaru, hoping to gain from him the strength
                needed to kill Itachi. The story takes a turn when Sasuke leaves the village: Tsunade sends a group of
                ninja, including Naruto, to retrieve Sasuke, but Naruto is unable to persuade or force him to come back.
                Naruto and Sakura do not give up on Sasuke; Naruto leaves Konoha to receive training from Jiraiya to
                prepare himself for the next time he encounters Sasuke, while Sakura becomes Tsunade's apprentice.

                Two and a half years later, Naruto returns from his training with Jiraiya. The Akatsuki starts
                kidnapping the hosts of the powerful Tailed Beasts. Team 7 and other Leaf ninja fight against them and
                search for their teammate Sasuke. The Akatsuki succeeds in capturing and extracting seven of the Tailed
                Beasts, killing all the hosts except Gaara, who is now the Kazekage. Meanwhile, Sasuke betrays
                Orochimaru and faces Itachi to take revenge. After Itachi dies in battle, Sasuke learns from the
                Akatsuki founder Tobi that Itachi had been ordered by Konoha's superiors to destroy his clan to prevent
                a coup; he accepted, on the condition that Sasuke would be spared. Devastated by this revelation, Sasuke
                joins the Akatsuki to destroy Konoha in revenge. As Konoha ninjas defeat several Akatsuki members, the
                Akatsuki figurehead leader, Nagato, kills Jiraiya and devastates Konoha, but Naruto defeats and redeems
                him, earning the village's respect and admiration.
                <br>
                <br>

                With Nagato's death, Tobi, disguised as Madara Uchiha (one of Konoha's founding fathers), announces that
                he wants to capture all nine Tailed Beasts to cast an illusion powerful enough to control all humanity
                and achieve world peace. The leaders of the five ninja villages refuse to help him and instead join
                forces to confront his faction and allies. That decision results in a Fourth Shinobi World War between
                the combined armies of the Five Great Countries (known as the Allied Shinobi Forces) and Akatsuki's
                forces of zombie-like ninjas. The Five Kage try to keep Naruto, unaware of the war, in a secret island
                turtle near Kumogakure (Hidden Cloud Village), but Naruto finds out and escapes from the island with
                Killer Bee, the host of the Eight-Tails. At that time, Naruto—along with the help of Killer Bee—gains
                control of his Tailed Beast and the two of them head for the battlefield.

                During the conflict, it is revealed that Tobi is Obito Uchiha and not Madara as he claimed. Obito is a
                former teammate of Kakashi's who was thought to be dead. The real Madara saved Obito's life, and they
                have since collaborated. As Sasuke learns the history of Konoha, including the circumstances that led to
                his clan's downfall, he decides to protect the village and rejoins Naruto and Sakura to thwart Madara
                and Obito's plans. However, Madara's body ends up possessed by Kaguya Otsutsuki, an ancient princess who
                intends to subdue all humanity. A reformed Obito sacrifices himself to help Team 7 stop her. Once Kaguya
                is sealed, Madara dies as well. Sasuke takes advantage of the situation and takes control of all the
                Tailed Beasts, as he reveals his goal of ending the current village system. Naruto confronts Sasuke to
                dissuade him from his plan, and after they almost kill each other in a final battle, Sasuke admits
                defeat and reforms. After the war, Kakashi becomes the Sixth Hokage and pardons Sasuke for his crimes.
                Years later, Kakashi steps down while Naruto marries Hinata Hyuga and becomes the Seventh Hokage,
                raising the next generation.</span>

                Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be more complicated than they seemed and that his

                events of the war left Obito disillusioned with reality, and he inherited Madara's plan to create an
                ideal world. Resurfacing under the names of Tobi (トビ, Tobi) and Madara Uchiha himself, Obito subtly took
